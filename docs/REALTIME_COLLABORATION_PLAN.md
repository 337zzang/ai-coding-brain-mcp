# Real-time Collaboration Feature - Strategic Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
**Feature**: Real-time collaboration for ai-coding-brain-mcp
**Complexity**: High (System Architecture Level)
**Timeline**: 4 weeks (21 working days)
**Think Mode**: "think harder" (2-4 weeks system architecture)

## Technical Analysis
- **Current Architecture**: Modular MCP server with 27 TypeScript files
- **Integration Points**: 4 identified (MCP server, Python bridge, Workflow manager, Session storage)
- **Event System**: Needs to be implemented

## Strategic Architecture (O3 Analysis)
### Recommended Pattern
**Event-Driven Microservice with WebSocket Gateway**

### Key Components
1. **Client Layer**: CollaborationClient SDK, WebSocketManager, ConflictResolver
2. **Gateway Layer**: WebSocket Gateway with Auth, Rate Limiting, Load Balancing
3. **Service Layer**: Collaboration Service, OT/CRDT Engine, Activity Tracker
4. **Data Layer**: Redis (sessions), PostgreSQL (activity), File System (state)

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
- **Primary**: Operational Transformation (OT) for text editing
- **Fallback**: CRDT for structural changes
- **Libraries**: ot.js, yjs, automerge

## Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data consistency issues | High | High | Robust OT/CRDT with testing |
| Performance degradation | Medium | High | Connection pooling, caching |
| Security vulnerabilities | Medium | Critical | Security audit, pen testing |
| MCP integration complexity | High | Medium | Modular design |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Battle-tested libraries |

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 days)
- WebSocket gateway setup
- Authentication middleware
- Session management
- Redis integration

### Phase 2: Collaboration Engine (5-6 days)
- OT engine implementation
- Conflict detection/resolution
- Change broadcasting
- Client SDK development

### Phase 3: Activity Tracking (3-4 days)
- Event capture system
- Activity aggregation
- Visualization components
- User presence tracking

### Phase 4: Integration (3-4 days)
- MCP workflow integration
- Performance optimization
- Connection pooling
- Error handling

### Phase 5: Testing & Hardening (2-3 days)
- Unit & integration testing
- Load testing (500+ users)
- Security testing
- Documentation

## Success Metrics
### Technical
- Latency: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Throughput: 1000+ ops/second
- Concurrent users: 500+ per project

### Quality
- Test coverage: 90% minimum
- Security: OWASP compliant
- Zero regression in existing features

### Business
- User adoption: 80% within 1 month
- Productivity: 25% reduction in conflicts
- Delivery: Within 4 weeks

## Agent Execution Chain
1. **planning-specialist** (current) → Strategic planning
2. **code-analyzer + test-runner** (parallel) → Analysis & test infrastructure
3. **code-optimizer** → Performance optimization
4. **test-runner + code-analyzer** (parallel) → Final validation

## Next Steps
1. Approve strategic plan
2. Initialize Phase 1 with code-analyzer
3. Set up monitoring dashboard
4. Begin WebSocket infrastructure
